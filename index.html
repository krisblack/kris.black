<p>Days of Sand, by AimÃ©e de Jongh, is a powerful story about a photographer who documented the people and conditions of the Dust Bowl in the early 1900â€™s in the United States.</p>

			 <p>I found this wonderful documentary on Kanopy about He-Man &amp; Masters of the Universe, <strong><em>Power of Grayskull</em></strong>. Itâ€™s a fascinating story about the entire history of how that franchise was born, thrived, and dwindled. There are interviews with creators, and wonderful photos and video clips from the franchiseâ€™s history.</p>
<p>One thing that really surprised me was learning that Moebius (yes the Moebius, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud">Jean Giraud</a>) was hired by William Stout to handle the character redesign of He-Man for the 80â€™s live action movie, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093507/">Masters of the Universe</a>.</p>

<p>As a kid, I was a huge He-Man fan and collector. I had Castle Grayskull, Snake Mountain, several vehicles, and a ton of the action figures. I loved how He-Man was larger than my other favorite line of toys: G.I. Joe, Star Wars, and Transformers. He-Man action figures were anatomically correct (for body builders) and designed in a pose always ready for action. Itâ€™s funny, because Star Wars action figures were not very actionable.</p>
<p>When my wife and I bought our first house in 2001, my parents brought all my childhood toys to give back to me. It was exciting to go through my huge toy collection. However, our house was small and we wanted to start a family in the near future, so we sold EVERYTHING on eBay. If I had kept everything it would have jump-started a side hustle business buying and selling vintage toys.</p>
<p>I have such fond memories playing with my 80â€™s toys in my room as a kid. When I was older and developed an appreciation of French comics and their creators, itâ€™s intriguing to know Moebius played a part in my childhood, even though I didnâ€™t know it back then.</p>

			 <p>Iâ€™ve been exploring some ideas for a new <a href="https://www.krisblack.com/original-art">canvas painting</a>. One of my ideas revolves around the use of colors from Appleâ€™s multi-color logo.</p>
<p>In my exploration I made a pretty neat background image for my iPhone using Procreate that I think many Apple fans will love as much as I do. So I thought I would share it here.</p>

<p>When the wallpaper is used on a Home Screen behind the app icons the blurring effect looks really nice.</p>

			 <p>Aimeeâ€™s dialogue in her graphic novel, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781772620399">Taxi!</a>, is punchy and precise. Not too much and not too little. She balances the medium of comicsâ€™ use of words and pictures to its fullest.</p>
<p>Her ability to guide your eye with carefully crafted black and white art leaves you wanting to devour all the details of her brush strokes.</p>

<p>Sheâ€™s a cartoonist Iâ€™m looking forward to reading for the rest of my life. Highly recommend this book.</p>

			 <p>Iâ€™ll be honest, Iâ€™m not much of a blogger. Iâ€™ve tried my hand at it off and on over the years with every popular content management system under the Sun.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a list of the platforms I can recall using.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> - Iâ€™m bias because I wrote <a href="/books" title="Books by Kris Black">two books about Squarespace</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> - it powers over 40% of the web</li>
<li><a href="https://www.movabletype.org">MovableType</a> - <a href="https://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>â€™s platform of choice</li>
<li><a href="https://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> - the original blogging site</li>
<li><a href="https://www.expressionengine.com">Expression Engine</a> - all the cool web designers used this back in the early to mid aughts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.typepad.com">Typepad</a> - used by <a href="https://seth.blog">Seth Godin</a> before he turned to WordPress</li>
<li><a href="https://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a> - short-lived fame</li>
<li><a href="https://www.realmacsoftware.com">Rapidweaver</a> - Iâ€™m a Mac fanboy, so of course I had to try this one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-i-didnt-stick-with-any-on-my-list">Why I didnâ€™t stick with any on my list</h2>
<h3 id="squarespace">Squarespace</h3>
<p>Blogging on Squarespace requires you to work within their platform. Whether itâ€™s in a browser on your computer or on their Apple or Android apps. Thereâ€™s not a way to publish posts from another third-party writing app like <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a> or <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wordpress">WordPress</h3>
<p>Iâ€™ve experimented with WordPress over the years. It excels at blogging, and fully supports publishing from third-party apps. Heck, WordPress practically invented and owns the blogging space on the internet. However, itâ€™s just too dang cumbersome to enjoy. Setting it up, expanding with plugins, choosing a theme, and figuring out hosting.</p>
<h3 id="movabletype">MovableType</h3>
<p>I think MovableType introduced me to Markdown. Itâ€™s been well over a decade since I used MovableType, but from what I remember creating a custom design wasnâ€™t intuitive. Maybe I was too early in my web dev journey, but I remember it being cumbersome.</p>
<h3 id="blogger">Blogger</h3>
<p>Blogger was fun. Simple in its approach. Unfortunately, it was bought by Google, and like most Google products it didnâ€™t continue to grow.</p>
<h3 id="expression-engine">Expression Engine</h3>
<p>Back in the aughts when I was still devouring all I could about web design, I remember noticing that HappyCog used Expression Engine for some of their client work. Itâ€™s a clean and simple platform. Ultimately it was not for me. Mainly because it was expensive at the time for my budget, and required an annual payment to use. Monthly would probably have been better for me and I may have stuck with it.</p>
<h3 id="typepad">Typepad</h3>
<p>If Iâ€™m remembering correctly, Typepad was a spawn of MovableType. It was a wonderful platform to use for a blog and small website. I canâ€™t remember why I quit using it. I think itâ€™s because I leaned into Squarespace as my platform of choice.</p>
<h3 id="livejournal">LiveJournal</h3>
<p>Honestly, I used this for probably a week. I thought it was not the best user experience. It was popular with some people, but not me.</p>
<h3 id="rapidweaver">Rapidweaver</h3>
<p>Yeah, being an Apple fanboy I had to try Rapidweaver. I wanted to love it, but itâ€™s hard when you want to be able to use your other devices to manage your site.</p>
<h2 id="squarespace-is-too-much">Squarespace is Too Much</h2>
<p>I have <a href="https://www.krisblack.com" title="Kris Black Studio">my art and cartooning site</a> on Squarespace. Itâ€™s solely focused on promoting my art, comics, and childrenâ€™s books Iâ€™m writing and illustrating. That site is strictly for selling and promoting my art.</p>
<p>I recently decided to just remove the blog entirely on my art site because I wasnâ€™t writing for it. I know I need to write more so I can explore and share ideas, but I want a site to do that independently of my art.</p>
<p>I need a place online to explore writing about design, being a creator, and probably my fanboy hobbies (Apple, comics, and Star Wars). The platform I write with needs to be simple, easy to use, focused heavily on words, and be accessible to third-party writing apps.</p>
<h2 id="enter-microblog">Enter Micro.blog</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve known about <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> for years, but dismissed it as a platform not focused for my needsâ€”that is until recently.</p>
<p>My good friend, <a href="https://bobwertz.com" title="Bob Wertz Website">Bob</a>, started using Micro.blog the last couple years. He has a Squarespace site, <a href="https://www.sketchbookb.com">Sketchbook B</a>, too he uses to sell his fonts. He used to blog on Squarespace within that site, but started using and singing the praises of Micro.blog.</p>
<p>This week I decided to try it again, and love it. I signed up for the lowest paid plan, picked a template, customized it (dark mode too), and called it done before the end of the work week.</p>
<p><a href="https://kris.black">My Micro.blog powered site</a> is now ready for me to write and share my ideas. It looks incredible IMHO, and works with my third-party writing app of choice, <a href="https://ulysses.app">Ulysses</a>.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m excited to see what I create to share on this site. Itâ€™s just lovely and Iâ€™m happy I decided to give Micro.blog a chance. You should give it a chance too. If you do let me know.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wanted a place where I could blog about design and being a Mac user, separate from <a href="https://www.krisblack.com">my other website</a>. Maybe some other stuff too. But those seem to be the two biggest things I have some opinions about.</p>
<p>I decided to use Micro.Blog for this after seeing my friend, <a href="https://bobwertz.com/">Bob</a>, have a lot of personal success with it. I also like the idea of supporting a very small team creating a platform that puts out a very simple and positive vibe on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how this site expands over the years, but I love the simplicity of it. In future posts I&rsquo;ll talk more about the tech aspects of this blog like the theme and any plugins I install. For now, I just wanted to say &ldquo;hello.&rdquo;</p>
